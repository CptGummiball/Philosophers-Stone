## Overview
**Philosophers Stone** is a collaborative project by CptGummiball and wolf128058, currently in the early stages of development. This GitHub repository is established for brainstorming and initial planning for a Spigot plugin written in Java.
## Purpose
The exact purpose of the **Philosophers Stone** plugin is yet to be defined. At this stage, the repository serves as a creative space for the authors to discuss ideas, experiment with different concepts, and collectively shape the direction of the project.
## Project Structure
The repository already includes essential components such as:
- **Command Class:** A foundation for handling commands within the plugin.
- **Logger Class:** A logging system to facilitate effective debugging and information tracking.
- **Translator Integration:** Enhancing the plugin's functionality with an integrated translator.

These elements, along with fundamental Java classes and necessary project files, provide a robust starting point for the authors and collaborators.
